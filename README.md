# Drift_and_selection

This R package contains functions to compute expected values of the site frequency spectrum of somatic variants generated by dividing tissues that are either expanding or homeostatic. Modalities for both, neutrally evolving tissues and tissues with clonal selection are provided.

The computations assume deterministic cell numbers in the tissue overall but account for the stochasticity of clonal growth at the level of individual clones, using clone size distributions generated by linear birth-death processes. 

Details on the method can be found in KÃ¶rber et al., Quantifying clonal selection from a single bulk tissue sample. An accompanying tutorail explaining how to use the package for parameter inference of drift and selection from bulk deep whole genome sequencing data or from single-cell WGS data is provided in the accompanying github repository ().
